# 6. Open TablePlus 

1. Proceed to DBNgin

2. Create and enable service named **AP2**

3. Invoke this command to the Machine Spirit
```
powershell

& "C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 9.4\bin\mysql.exe" -u root -p
```

4. Run this to check if created database was successful
```
mysql

CREATE DATABASE A2P CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON A2P.* TO 'edison'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
SHOW DATABASES;
```


___


# 7. Configure .env file

1. Find this
```
plaintext

DB_CONNECTION=sqlite
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=laravel
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=
```

2. Edit to match mysql server config
```
plaintext

DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=a2p
DB_USERNAME=test
DB_PASSWORD=admin@12345
```

# 8. Laravel Migration

üí° **Context:** Migration is a **system** that enables the *creating* and *modifying* of a table through PHP instead of SQL

1. Type this in your terminal within your workspace file
```
bash

php artisan make:migration create_40k_starter_book --create=books
```

2. Go to recently created table

2. Insert this in the `up` method
```
php

public function up(): void
    {
        Schema::create('books', function (Blueprint $table) {
            $table->id();
            $table->string('chapter', 40)->nullable(false);
            $table->integer('price')->nullable(false);
            $table->string('author', 80)->nullable(false);
            $table->timestamps();
        });
    }
```

4. Run **php artisan migrate** to apply the migration.

## Code Analysis

**ID Field**
```
php

$table->id();
```
This declares a **primary key column** named `id`. This field auto-increments with each migration.

**Chapter Field**
```
php

$table->string('chapter', 40)->nullable(false);
```
This declares a **string column** named `chapter` (40 characters maximum). This field is required.

**Price Field**
```
php

$table->integer('price')->nullable(false);
```
This declares an **integer column** named `price` (no character limit). This field is required.

**Author Field**
```
php

$table->string('author', 80)->nullable(false);
```
This declares an **string column** named `author` (80 character maximum). This field is required.

**Timestamp Field**
```
php

$table->timestamps();
```
This declares 2 **timestamp columns** named `created_at` and `updated_at`. This field is generated automatically.

**Error Output:**
```
powershell

php artisan migrate

    Illuminate\Database\QueryException 

    SQLSTATE[HY000] [1045] Access denied for user 'edison'@'localhost' (using password: YES) (Connection: mysql, SQL: select exists (select 1 from information_schema.tables where table_schema = schema() and table_name = 'migrations' and table_type in ('BASE TABLE', 'SYSTEM VERSIONED')) as `exists`)

    826‚ñï             );
    827‚ñï         }
    828‚ñï     }

    1   vendor\laravel\framework\src\Illuminate\Database\Connectors\Connector.php:67
        PDOException::("SQLSTATE[HY000] [1045] Access denied for user 'edison'@'localhost' (using password: YES)")

        PDO::connect("mysql:host=127.0.0.1;port=3306;dbname=a2p", "edison", Object(SensitiveParameterValue), [])
```

**Solution:**

1. Use the root password
```
powershell

& "C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 9.4\bin\mysql.exe" -u root -p
```

2. Check if `edison` exists
```
mysql

SELECT user, host, plugin FROM mysql.user WHERE user = 'edison';
ALTER USER 'edison'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH caching_sha2_password BY 'admin@12345678';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON a2p.* TO 'edison'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
exit
```

3. Ensure that the password in .env file is the same one in the MySQL server
```
bash

DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=a2p
DB_USERNAME=edison
DB_PASSWORD=admin@12345678
MYSQL_ATTR_SSL_CA=null
```

4. Retry migration
```
bash

php artisan migrate
```


# 10. Creating a Model

1. Create the model
```
bash

php artisan make:model Book
```

2. Insert `protected $fillable` for mass assignment
```
php

// Allow mass assignment for these columns
    protected $fillable = ['name', 'price', 'author'];
```
üí° **Context:** $fillable states which field should be automatically filled in.


# 11. Initiating a Seeding

1. Run this
```
bash
php artisan make:seeder BookSeeder
```
üí° **Context:** A seeding is inserting data into the table *when the application starts* via running commands.

2. Navigate to `database/seeders` and open `BookSeeder.php`.

3. Modify to your liking. Here is an example.

```
php

public function run(): void
    {
        // Clean table every time app opens
        DB::table('books')->truncate();

        // Add new row with these data
        $books = [
            ['name' => 'Book of the Machine God', 'price' => 30, 'author' => 'Games Workshop'],
            ['name' => 'Starter Book of Warhammer 40K', 'price' => 25, 'author' => 'Games Workshop'],
            ['name' => 'Advanced Book of Warhammer 40K', 'price' => 40, 'author' => 'Games Workshop']
        ];
    }
```
üìù **Note:** Since the prerequiste is to have `created at` and `updated at` timestamps automatically assigned.

4. Run `php artisan db:seed` to apply seeding

**Error Output:**
```
php

php artisan db:seed

   INFO  Seeding database.


   Error 

  Class "Database\Seeders\DB" not found

     15‚ñï     {
     16‚ñï         // Clean table every time app opens
  ‚ûú  17‚ñï         DB::table('books')->truncate();
     18‚ñï
     19‚ñï         // Add new row with these data
     20‚ñï         $books = [
     21‚ñï             ['name' => 'Book of the Machine God', 'price' => 30, 'author' => 'Games Workshop'],

  1   vendor\laravel\framework\src\Illuminate\Container\BoundMethod.php:36
      Database\Seeders\DatabaseSeeder::run()

  2   vendor\laravel\framework\src\Illuminate\Container\Util.php:43
      Illuminate\Container\BoundMethod::{closure:Illuminate\Container\BoundMethod::call():35}()
```

**Solution:**
```
php

namespace Database\Seeders;

use Illuminate\Database\Seeder;
use App\Models\Book;

class DatabaseSeeder extends Seeder
{
    /**
     * Seed the application's database.
     */
    public function run(): void
    {
        // Clean table every time app opens
        Book::truncate();

        // Define the seed data
        $books = [
            ['name' => 'Book of the Machine God', 'price' => 30, 'author' => 'Games Workshop'],
            ['name' => 'Starter Book of Warhammer 40K', 'price' => 25, 'author' => 'Games Workshop'],
            ['name' => 'Advanced Book of Warhammer 40K', 'price' => 40, 'author' => 'Games Workshop'],
        ];

        // Insert each book using Eloquent, timestamps will auto-generate
        foreach ($books as $book) {
            Book::create($book);
        }

        $this->command->info('Books table seeded successfully!');
    }
}
```

# 11. Controller & Routing

1. Type this into `web.php` at `/routes/`

```
php

use App\Http\Controllers\BookController;

Route::get('book', 'BookController@index');
```

This enables the Machine Spirit's client request to be directed to the *controller* rather than *returned*.

2. Create the controller
```
bash
php artisan make:controller BookController
```

3. Insert this after **namespace**
```
php

use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use App\Http\Controllers\Controller;
use App\Book;
```

4. Write the method to **retrieve all books**
```
php

class BookController extends Controller {
    public function index() {
    // Retrieve all values from the Book table
    $books = Book::all();


    // Pass the retrieved values to the ‚Äúbook/index‚Äù view
    return view('book/index', compact('books'));
    }
}
```

5. Write the method to **edit a book**
```
php

public function edit($id) {
    $book = Book::findOrFail($id);

    return view('book/edit', compact('book') );
}
```
